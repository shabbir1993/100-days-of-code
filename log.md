# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0:  July 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setup the first Prototype of Twitch TV App from FCC.

**Thoughts:** I can get the data of users and their status, but utilizing this data via ReactJS states is a challenge and it has some issue I need to work on ASAP.

**Link to work:** [Twitch TV Client](https://github.com/shabbir1993/twitch-client)

### Day 2:  July 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Unable to work on it because of system HDD failure, will buy new SSD tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I've backed all the code on Github though still need to have a solid backup approach.

### Day 2:  July 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setup development environment on newly installed SSD with fresh Windows 10. Installed rails and developed and push a couple projects to production alongwith SCM integration(Bitbucket).

**Thoughts:** Will quickly push towards first prototype of a Social Media App as I already know Rails well enough, todays task was just a drill (Well, most of it :) ).
