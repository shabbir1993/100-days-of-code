# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0:  July 2, 2017 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Setup the first Prototype of Twitch TV App from FCC.

**Thoughts:** I can get the data of users and their status, but utilizing this data via ReactJS states is a challenge and it has some issue I need to work on ASAP.

**Link to work:** [Twitch TV Client](https://github.com/shabbir1993/twitch-client)
